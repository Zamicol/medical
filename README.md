Zami's Medical Information

Because !*#$ HIPAA.

I would prefer to keep my medical information unknown by insurance companies and the feds, but they both already have it.  

If by chance this information helps research or other people, here is a record of all my medical information.  

It also makes it easier to get to my own records down the road when I have everything saved to one, public place.
